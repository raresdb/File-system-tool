#Butilca Rares

This is a program that can be used as a front-end CLI for the implementation of a file system.

This manager has implemented the well-known commands used in linux:
- cd,
- touch,
- mkdir,
- ls,
- rm,
- rmdir(rm -r),
- pwd,
- tree,
- mv.

Once run, the program prompts the user with a CLI shell where they can run all of the above
commands untill the command stop(equivalent to closing the terminal) is given.
